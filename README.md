Gett, a technology platform focused on transportation management, has an application that allows customers to order taxi and drivers to accept their rides.

In this project, I would like to investigate some matching metrics for orders that were not completed successfully (the curstomer did not end up getting a car).

The analysis consists of the following components:

- Building up a distribution of orders according to reasons for failure: cancellations before and after assignment, and the reason for order rejection.

- Plotting the distribution of failed orders by hour, and check is there a trend that certain hours have an abnormally high proportion of one category than another, and how could the trend be explained.

- Plotting the average time to cancellation with and without drive to check if there are any outliers in the data. If there are, remove them and draw further conclusions from the plot

- Plotting the distribution of average ETA by hours and explain the trend observed in the plot.
